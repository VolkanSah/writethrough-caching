# Writethrough caching
Writethrough caching is a technique that allows data to be written to the disk before it is flushed from the cache. This ensures that all data is saved to the disk before the server is restarted, and that the data is available in the cache after the restart.

###General steps to configure writethrough caching:

Mount the file system with the writethrough option.
When you mount a file system, you can specify the caching strategy using the writethrough option. This tells the system to write data to the disk before it is flushed from the cache. Here's an example of how to mount a file system with the writethrough option:

```bash
mount -o writethrough /dev/sda1 /mnt/data
```
This mounts the file system on /dev/sda1 with the writethrough caching strategy, and assigns it to the /mnt/data mount point.

Use sync to flush the cache.
The sync command can be used to flush data from the cache to the disk. This ensures that all data is written to the disk before the server is restarted. Here's an example of how to use sync:

```bash
sync
```
This flushes all data from the cache to the disk.

Restart the server.
After the data has been flushed to the disk, you can restart the server using the appropriate command for your system.

Mount the file system again after the restart.
Once the server has restarted, you need to mount the file system again using the same writethrough option. This ensures that the data is available in the cache after the restart. Here's an example of how to mount the file system after the restart:

```bash
mount -o writethrough /dev/sda1 /mnt/data
```
This mounts the file system on /dev/sda1 with the writethrough caching strategy, and assigns it to the /mnt/data mount point.

By using the writethrough caching strategy and the sync command, you can ensure that all data is written to the disk before the server is restarted, and that the data is available in the cache after the restart. This can help prevent data loss and ensure that the server is restarted smoothly.
